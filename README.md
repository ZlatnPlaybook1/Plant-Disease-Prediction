# 🌱 Plant Disease Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images.  
It leverages the **PlantVillage dataset** containing 38 classes of healthy and diseased plants.  
The system aims to support **smart agriculture** by enabling early detection and treatment of crop diseases.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Built a **CNN-based deep learning model** for disease classification.  
- ✅ Trained on **38 plant diseases** using the **PlantVillage dataset**.  
- ✅ Achieved **high accuracy** through preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization.  
- ✅ Implemented with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and evaluation.  
- ✅ Deployed an **inference pipeline using Docker**, making it portable for real-world agricultural use.
